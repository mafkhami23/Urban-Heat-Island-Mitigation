## 📘 Introduction
This project is a data-driven investigation into the growing threat of urban heat islands (UHI) in American cities. Using a combination of satellite imagery, socioeconomic data, and first-hand community surveys, the study reveals how temperature extremes are not only shaped by the built environment but also affect behavior, health, and urban livability. Conducted in Dallas, Texas, this research serves as a blueprint for cities aiming to develop informed, equitable, and heat-resilient design strategies.

## 🌡️ Current State
In the summer of 2023, many regions in the U.S. experienced the hottest recorded temperatures in history. Texas, for example, saw over 27 consecutive days above 100°F. Projections indicate that by 2053, parts of the Midwest could experience more than 70 consecutive days with a heat index above 100°F. If urban planning practices remain unchanged, the 2023 extreme heat could become the new normal.

Cities—while only covering 1% of Earth’s surface—consume 78% of global energy. Urban materials like asphalt and concrete trap heat, intensifying the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. UHI increases cooling costs, worsens air quality, and elevates health risks, especially among vulnerable populations. Understanding and mitigating this phenomenon is critical for the future of urban design.

## 🔍 Research Scope
This project integrates geospatial satellite data, socioeconomic overlays, and qualitative surveys to evaluate UHI impacts across five Dallas neighborhoods. The study uses:
- **NASA Landsat imagery (2015–2023)** for Land Surface Temperature (LST) and NDVI
- **Google Earth Engine** for temporal pixel-level analysis
- **GIS parcel overlays** with zoning and building typologies
- **15 resident interviews per study zone** (60+ total), capturing behavioral and emotional responses to extreme heat
- **Likert-scale survey data** to statistically analyze impacts of heat on daily life, outdoor activity, and concern levels

The study selected five differentneighborhood and residential areas based on thier factors such as:
- **Population density
- **Proximity to downtown
- ** Socioeconomic status

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Construction zones** showed the steepest increase in land surface temperature over time
- **Commercial parcels** recorded average LSTs 5.45°F higher than residential parcels
- **>90%** of residents reported reduced outdoor activity during extreme heat
- **Indoor activity, sleep disruption, and health concerns** increased with higher LST and lower NDVI
- **Statistical significance** was found between neighborhood typologies, vegetation levels, and behavioral impacts

The study showed that heat related issues are major concern for people living in urban envieonments and the configuration of each neighborhood plays a statistically significant role in the magnitude of behaviors in reaction to heatwave.
It also demonstrated how huge majority [ >90%] low-income participants either agree or strongly agree that high temperature has curtailed their outoor activities
